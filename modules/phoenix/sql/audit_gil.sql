-- Gil Economy Ledger Module
--
-- One row per observed gil balance change, written by the gil_audit C++ module.
--
-- `balance_after` is authoritative (post-clamp, as sent to the client).
-- `delta` is the movement the module saw, NULL when it had no earlier balance for the character.
-- Summing `delta` per character and comparing to char_inventory shows gil that moved unobserved:
-- disabled categories, offline edits, or the server running with the module off.
--
-- Fuller detail for some paths lives in the audit table that owns them:
--   VendorBuy/Sell  audit_vendor    quantity, npc name, prices
--   BazaarBuy/Sell  audit_bazaar    both parties (counterparty is left 0 here)
--   AuctionBid      auction_house   the listing the bid won
--   PlayerTrade     audit_trade     every traded item (gil is itemid 65535)
--   DeliveryBox     audit_dbox      sender and receiver names
--
-- A movement the core later undoes (a refund when the other half of a bazaar or AH purchase fails)
-- shows as a second row that cancels the first; the balance stays right, the row count does not mean sales.
--
-- Schema changes need a tools/migrations entry: dbtool only creates this table when it does not exist.
--
-- Note: This table preserves existing data during database updates.
--       The table structure will only be created if it doesn't exist.
